How to run fgmapping
====================

Requirements:
- ruby of course. Min version 1.8.6 up to 1.9.2
- either:qtruby4, minimum version 4.4
	see: http://rubyforge.org/projects/korundum
	debian/ubuntu: sudo apt-get install libqt4-ruby
  or: qtbindings, min version 4.6.3.1
	sudo gem install qtbindings


Run:
You basically have 2 options:

1) (you already have ruby and qtruby installed)
- unpack the 'fgmap.tar.gz' into any directory
- cd into this directory
- on shell type: ruby waypoint.rb

2) (you already have ruby and rubygems installed)
- type: sudo gem install fgmapping
- make sure /var/lib/gems/1.*/bin is in your standard path ($PATH)
- execute 'fgmapping'

In any case you need to launch Flightgear like this:
- run Flightgear with additional command line option: --telnet=2948


Development:
Download git repository:
- git clone git://rubyforge.org/fgmap.git
Remarks for development:     
- .ui files can be edited with QT designer
- corresponding .rb files are generated by just issuing 'make'


Enjoy.
