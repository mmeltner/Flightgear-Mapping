How to run fgmap
================

Requirements:
- ruby of course. Min version 1.8.6
- qtruby4, minimum version 4.4
	see: http://rubyforge.org/projects/korundum
	debian/ubuntu: sudo apt-get install libqt4-ruby
- xml bindings libxml
	see: http://libxml.rubyforge.org
	debian/ubuntu: sudo apt-get install libxml-ruby


Run:
You basically have 3 options:

1) (you already have ruby and qtruby installed)
- unpack the 'fg-map.tar.gz' into any directory
- cd into this directory
- on shell type: ruby init.rb

2) (you already have ruby and rubygems installed)
- type: sudo gem install fgmapping

3) (you don't have ruby installed, don't even know what this is)
- download "fg-map_linux"
- change permission to 'executable': chmod 774 fg-map_linux
- to run it, just type ./fg-map_linux

In any case you need to launch Flightgear like this:
- run Flightgear with additional command line option: --telnet=2948


Develop:
- .ui files can be edited with QT designer
- corresponding .rb files are generated by just issuing 'make'


Enjoy.
